### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexis, I am a person that everyone would say is introverted, but once I feel comfortable in an environment, i feel that I can accomplish anything with my entire team.

I think that like many developers, in spite of loving what we do, sometimes we are overwhelmed by the immense sea of new technologies to learn, however I think that keeps us motivated, the fact of thinking we can be much better than we already are.

I love the color pink in certain context, like in plants or in my favorite tree, Sakura.
